I worked in a two man group (myself and a friend) to create a 
web application with a backend spring API. The application allowed you to create, manage, and view
tournaments. A person creating a tournament could also invite others to view the tournament as well.
The application was developed in 4 weeks with me primarily working as a bac end developer with
my group member focusing on the front end. I created the database and backend Spring boot AP while
also helping my group member integrate the front end seamlessly with my API.
