Here is all the Java code for the final project (the package is called 'fProj'):

- If you are trying to test the Radar GUI, run 'Test.java' (you may modify the values within 'SampleTest.txt').

- If you are trying to test the Map GUI, run 'Map.java' (if connected to bot) or 'MapWithoutBot.java' (if not connected to bot).
  Also, you may once again edit or add any values within 'SampleTest.txt'.
